 * The <i>Sample Group Description Box</i> table gives information about the
 * characteristics of sample groups. The descriptive information is any other
 * information needed to define or characterize the sample group.
 *
 * There may be multiple instances of this box if there is more than one sample
 * grouping for the samples in a track. Each instance of the Sample Group
 * Description box has a type code that distinguishes different sample
 * groupings. Within a track, there shall be at most one instance of this box
 * with a particular grouping type. The associated Sample To Group shall
 * indicate the same value for the grouping type.
