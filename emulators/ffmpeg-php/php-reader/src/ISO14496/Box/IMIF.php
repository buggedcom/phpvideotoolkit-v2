/**
 * The <i>IPMP Information Box</i> contains IPMP Descriptors which document the
 * protection applied to the stream.
 *
 * IPMP_Descriptor is defined in 14496-1. This is a part of the MPEG-4 object
 * descriptors (OD) that describe how an object can be accessed and decoded.
 * Here, in the ISO Base Media File Format, IPMP Descriptor can be carried
 * directly in IPMP Information Box without the need for OD stream.
 *
 * The presence of IPMP Descriptor in this box indicates the associated media
 * stream is protected by the IPMP Tool described in the IPMP Descriptor.
 *
 * Each IPMP_Descriptor has an IPMP_ToolID, which identifies the required IPMP
 * tool for protection. An independent registration authority (RA) is used so
 * any party can register its own IPMP Tool and identify this without
 * collisions.
 *
 * The IPMP_Descriptor carries IPMP information for one or more IPMP Tool
 * instances, it includes but not limited to IPMP Rights Data, IPMP Key Data,
 * Tool Configuration Data, etc.
 *
 * More than one IPMP Descriptors can be carried in this box if this media
 * stream is protected by more than one IPMP Tools.
