 * The <i>Movie Fragment Random Access Offset Box</i> provides a copy of the
 * length field from the enclosing {@link ISO14496_Box_MFRA Movie Fragment
 * Random Access Box}. It is placed last within that box, so that the size field
 * is also last in the enclosing Movie Fragment Random Access Box. When the
 * Movie Fragment Random Access Box is also last in the file this permits its
 * easy location. The size field here must be correct. However, neither the
 * presence of the Movie Fragment Random Access Box, nor its placement last in
 * the file, are assured.
