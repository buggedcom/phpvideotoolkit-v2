 * The <i>Track Reference Box</i> provides a reference from the containing track
 * to another track in the presentation. These references are typed. A {@link
 * ISO14496_Box_HINT hint} reference links from the containing hint track to the
 * media data that it hints. A content description reference {@link
 * ISO14496_Box_CDSC cdsc} links a descriptive or metadata track to the content
 * which it describes.
 * 
 * Exactly one Track Reference Box can be contained within the {@link
 * ISO14496_Box_TRAK Track Box}.
 *
 * If this box is not present, the track is not referencing any other track in
 * any way. The reference array is sized to fill the reference type box.
