            <h1>PHPVideoToolkit V2...</h1>
            <p>...is a set of PHP classes aimed to provide a modular, object oriented and accessible interface for interacting with videos and audio through <a href="http://ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg</a>.</p>
			<p>It also currently provides FFmpeg-PHP emulation in pure PHP so you wouldn't need to compile and install the module. As FFmpeg-PHP has not been updated since 2007 using FFmpeg-PHP with a new version of FFmpeg can often break the module. Using PHPVideoToolkits' emulation of FFmpeg-PHP's functionality allows you to upgrade FFmpeg without worrying about breaking existing funcitonality.</p>
